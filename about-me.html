      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p style="background-color:darkslateblue">
        TL;DR: Supposedly adult man spends many hours over two weeks attempting to craft a
        personal website only to end up with ugly 90's-era blog post
      </p>

      <p>Where to start?</p>

      <p>A long time ago, well, 14 days ago, in a galaxy - never mind.</p>

      <p>
        It's a tale as old as time - as the universe expands, so the scope does creep, and
        so on and so forth, until the bitter end.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the admission project instructions said ‚ÄúBuild a website about
        yourself. Trust us, it's not that hard,‚Äù I really did trust that I could
        do it. I truly believed I could do it. Unfortunately, I was incorrect.
      </p>

      <p>
        First,
        <a href="https://youtu.be/H6u0VBqNBQ8?si=HXJrnee8qDYqo4C1"
          >what even is 'the self'</a
        >? What am I even doing here? These are questions for another day. All I
        know is that decades of living with ADHD have left me with interests
        that seemingly change with the wind. So what exactly should I include in a project about myself?
      </p>
      <h2>Idea 01: Nature and Outdoors</h2>
      <p>
        For the past couple of years, my most consistent interest has been being
        outside: camping, hiking and taking photos. But is there anything more
        boring that being forced to look at some random dude's mediocre nature
        photos? No. No there is not. When one manages to get a boringly adequate
        shot of a Greater Yellowlegs, it's a you-had-to-be-there kind of thing,
        correct?
      </p>

      <h2>Idea 02: Technology</h2>
      <p>
        So then I thought, how about when I first started being interested in
        tech and computers after my father bought a mail-order programming
        course which included a
        <a href="https://www.timexsinclair.com/computers/timex-sinclair-1500/"
          >Timex Sinclair 1500</a
        >. Yes! That could be interesting. And I'll theme it around the concept
        of magic boxes. From my first magic box: a Fisher Price Magic Show toy, 
        and onward. So, I tried to find some good images of these various boxes.
        Mostly I could only find ebay-quality snapshots - so I thought I'll try
        Dall-E. Well, Dall-E's ability to render old technology is inversely
        proportional to the age of said technology, so it wasn't quite what I
        was looking for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then -- aha! I'll make then in Blender. I dabbled in Blender about
        couple of years back, following a few tutorials and
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/blendertutorial/"
          >a course on udemy.com</a
        >. I mean, these old computers and stuff are just constructed of boxes,
        right? Easy! Maybe I'll even figure out how to make them interactive in
        WebGL! I open Blender only to realize that I've forgotten all the
        keyboard shortcuts, how to navigate in the viewport, or basically how to
        do anything at all. And that trying to do anything in Blender with a
        trackpad on my 13-inch MacBook is well, not fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I opened Blender, the most recent file was ‚Äúnanskitchen_01.blend‚Äù
        which I started back in December 2022. I was intending to add festive
        elements then print it out for my sister as her present. But I ran out
        of time, or was distracted by a squirrel or something, and of course I
        didn't finish it. Oh! I know, I'll make a portfolio of a bunch of my
        unfinished projects.

      <h2>Idea 03: Portfolio of Unfinished Projects</h2>
      <p>
        One of these unfinished projects being a game that is somewhat of a
        tribute to both of my grandmothers. Called ‚ÄúWeiners(sic) from Heaven‚Äù, I
        made a
        <a href="https://indreams.me/scene/dsfApZJqMCD"
          >short demo scene in Dreams</a
        >
        for PS4 during Snowmageddon 2020. I was really enthusiastic about this
        project, but I got stuck when trying animate where the main character,
        Nan, picks up the receiver of a rotary telephone. I now know why you
        rarely see characters visually interacting with objects in video games.

      <p>
        Anyway, I figured that wasn't really much of a story to base this project
        on. So, I figured I'd make a Wikipedia-style page about the game. I
        started thinking of what images I'd want to include and how to make it
        compelling enough to read. So over the course of several days I
        developed a backstory and mythology about the game and generated images
        with Dall-E.

      <p>
        After getting a restful night's sleep and then reviewing what I'd made in the morning, I
        realised that I'd basically iterated on an inside joke that would probably only be funny to me.
        Like when I was 10 and myself and my cousin and I wrote that story about a man who
        worked canning beans in a factory, but couldn't stop eating the beans,
        and subsequently developed a serious(ly funny) flatulence problem. We
        typed it up on my Commodore 64, printed it out, then typed that into
        <a href="https://discordier.github.io/sam/"
          >SAM (Software Automated Mouth)</a
        >
        and through choking fits of laughter, we thought we were going to be
        rich, because it was clearly the most hilarious thing that has ever been
        written. Ever!
      </p>

      <p>
        So then, I completely switched tactics - I'll pick my top three most
        embarrassing ADHD moments, turn them into 3-panel comics, figure out how to 
        add a bit of animation and some transition effects, yeah!
        Then I realized that even when prompting for specific features in Dall-E, it's
        difficult to get a consistent character, and there are issues with
        object continuity and style. Scrap that idea.

        />
        <figcaption>
          On the first day of kindergarten we were given an worksheet with
          activities on it. One of these was a white sheep with the instruction
          "Colour the sheep white." I thought, "Well, the sheep is already white
          - why waste the effort of colouring it when it is literally already
          white?". When the teacher passed me the page back with that part
          marked wrong, she rubbed the sheep with her finger indicating how she
          knew I hadn't coloured it because she couldn't feel any crayon on it.
          I explained that I understood what the sentence said, but that colouring 
          the sheep was pointless because it was already white.
          What I learned that day was that school was about following directions
          to the letter, and critical thinking or questioning things were really
          neither appreciated nor encouraged.

        There is more to tell and even more rabbit holes I managed to fall into that I won't get
        into here. (like when I thought I'd
        <a href="./tangent.server/index.html"
          >simulate an old-school BBS called "Tangent Server"</a
        >
        (an anagram of my name, and also highly appropriate if you've been
        following along up to this point). Then I got stuck when I couldn't
        figure out how to hide the focus on the input field.

        So - what you wanted was a blog post with a wall of text, right? Right??

        PS: I did actually learn lots over the past couple of weeks. Like CSS
        Grid (amazing!) I love learning new things and have lots of enthusiasm,
        but really struggle when I'm left on my own to channel it into finished
        projects as my brain tends to go madly off in all directions. I could 
        really use some coaching and guidance. Please help!
